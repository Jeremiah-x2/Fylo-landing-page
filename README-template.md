## My process

I recently just got to found a couple of challenges that I did from the frontendmentor website which this was among. Did the challenge at the start of the year, just get to practice what I've been learning, such as layouts using flexbox, making pages responsive and solidifying my javascript. It was a smooth process from what I can remember as I did not have much of a hard time carrying out the challenge. Recently added some of the features from the challenge though.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly layouts and responsiveness
